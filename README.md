## Mission 🔭 

Technology is ready for innovation at a scale that has, until now, only been seen once before - at a scale akin to the very inception of digital computing. 

Electronic computers enabled infinitely many tasks to be executed without requiring a human. Even with a computer, a person is still required to define, explore, refine, and otherwise develop those tasks. As well, a person typically holds responsibility for triggering tasks and adding per-use-case inputs. 

Generative artificial intelligence is the second wave of digital computing. Machine learning can be considered the precursing requirement, but the scope is meaningfully different. Machine learning still had the basic person-in-the-loop requirement for task development and execution. Generative artificial intelligence removes the unwavering person-in-the-loop requirement for all tasks, including development itself. 

Computing as a field can be considered the pursuit of creating an electronic powered human equivalent. "Success" won't replace the need for people, but it will raise the bar for what people can achieve. Imagine if even the most junior student could explore, create, and execute with the equivalent of a University-scale research department and an enterprise-scale workforce. 

### Define: Development 🚀

One "unit of development" in computing is removing one person-in-the-loop interaction in a way that is scalable. Scalable means enabling any number of those interactions and enabling interactions of any size (with respect to either of the input or output). 

One "unit of development" in any pursuit is identified by moving any desired output one step closer to the request and input. Many systems are composed of inner systems, and are typically only considered in case of exploring any further opportunity. Further opportunity is explored through optimization, expansion, or some combination of both.

The output of development is typically "another system to maintain". This creates an infinitely-expansive balance between system development and system maintenance. For any system, both system development and system maintenance typically utilize the same input fuel; in some cases, multiple fuel options. If there is an abundance of fuel, the outermost system is responsible for assigning the fuel to correctly balance development and maintenance. 

Many systems start by prioritizing continuity, given continuity without development is possible where development without continuity is not. As a system expands, what was once an inner system may become the outermost system. If the outermost system fails to correctly maintain the required balance - by either failing to correctly measure the balance or by showing disproportionate bias towards maintenance - all inner systems are put at risk. 

If a misbalance is found, it presents the opportunity for creation of new adjacent systems to help correct that balance. As well, all inner systems are at risk of replacement or deprecation. A misbalance is most often found when either:
1. The outermost system has other, unstated priorities that inner systems are unaware of. Or;
2. When the balance itself cannot be accurately measured, owing to either:
    - Inadequate measurement techniques available to an outer system. Or;
    - Metrics being incorrectly reported by an inner system.  

### Gear Up 🏎️

Generative artificial intelligence provides more than just machine-powered thinking: it presents a suite of resources that can be used to better enable all pre-existing technologies. As a result, it both identifies weaknesses in existing systems and weaknesses in how existing systems were developed. Any collision of ability and resources at this scale creates a proportionately scaled Big Bang-esque event. 

**Where balance "should be" has changed almost overnight - any existing systems that fail to adjust accordingly are at risk of extinction. **

That risk is considerably higher for any existing systems that have known about this shift and have already been forcibly skewing the balance on account of unstated priorities. That is because they have already been managing two balances: balance between known available development and stated available development, which is in turn used to determine balance between maintenance-focused units and development-focused units. Just like priorities are tiered, balance itself is also tiered.

## Universe Shots 🌌

### Universe Shot 1: Developer Zeroth Development
As onboarding and contributing becomes more difficult, the ability to drive further value creation slows and may eventually appear to halt. 

All artifacts (code, written documents, and anything else) should pass the following checks:
1. Should a junior contributor reasonably understand this contribution?
2. Could a junior contributor easily understand the significance of ?
3. 

### Universe Shot 2: User Enablement
The number of potential users is typically measured by the number of people already performing something where the product or system would facilitate overall execution. 

The number of potential users is typically measured against existing actors, and some calculated number of potential actors. The reality is that everyone is a potential user: an unnecessarily high barrier to entry does not imply a lack of wanting to onboard from any non-user. 

All offerings should maintain the following goals:
1. All users should be able to use it without any precursing instruction
